```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```{r}
evals <- readr::read_tsv("https://www.openintro.org/data/tab-delimited/evals.txt")
```

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(evals)
```

```{r}
hist(evals$score)
```

The distribution is left skewed.

```{r}
evals %>% ggplot(aes( y = age, 
                      x = gender,
                      fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Age of the Student",
       x = "Gender of the Student",
    title = "Distribution of students' Age vs Gender") + 
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

From the above plot we can say that most of the female students are of age of 45 and most of the male students are age of around 50.

```{r}
evals %>% select(starts_with("bty_")) %>% ggpairs
  
```

```{r}
m_bty_gen <- lm(score ~ bty_avg + gender, data = evals)
tidy(m_bty_gen)
```

```{r}
m_int <- lm(score ~ bty_avg * gender, data = evals)
tidy(m_int)
```

```{r}
r_int <- lm(score ~ bty_avg * rank, data = evals)
tidy(r_int)
```
